## 🚀 Quickstart & Usage Examples

### 🐍 Python

#### 1. Load Data and Search for a Station
```python
import json

# Load stations
with open("stations.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    stations = json.load(f)

# Find station by code
station_code = "NDLS"
station = next((s for s in stations if s["code"] == station_code), None)
print(f"Station: {station['name']}, State: {station['state']}, Zone: {station['zone']}")
print(f"Coordinates: {station['coordinates']['latitude']}, {station['coordinates']['longitude']}")
```

#### 2. Search for Trains and View Timetable
```python
import json

# Load trains
with open("trains.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    trains = json.load(f)

# Find train by number
train_num = "12951"
train = next((t for t in trains if t["trainNumber"] == train_num), None)

if train:
    print(f"🚆 {train['trainNumber']} - {train['trainName']} ({train['type']})")
    print(f"Route: {train['source']['name']} ➔ {train['destination']['name']} ({train['overallDistanceKm']} km)")
    print("\n--- Stops ---")
    for stop in train["completeOrderedRoute"]:
        arr = stop["arrivalTime"] or "Origin"
        dep = stop["departureTime"] or "Destination"
        print(f"[{stop['sequence']:02d}] {stop['stationCode']:<5} {stop['stationName']:<25} Arr: {arr:<10} Dep: {dep:<10} Day {stop['journeyDay']}")
```

#### 3. Find Direct Trains Between Two Stations
```python
import json

def find_direct_trains(src_code, dest_code, trains):
    matches = []
    for train in trains:
        station_codes = [s["stationCode"] for s in train["completeOrderedRoute"]]
        if src_code in station_codes and dest_code in station_codes:
            src_idx = station_codes.index(src_code)
            dest_idx = station_codes.index(dest_code)
            if src_idx < dest_idx:  # verify direction
                matches.append(train)
    return matches

with open("trains.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    trains = json.load(f)

results = find_direct_trains("BVI", "NDLS", trains)
print(f"Found {len(results)} direct trains from BVI to NDLS:")
for t in results:
    print(f"- {t['trainNumber']}: {t['trainName']}")
```

### 🌐 JavaScript / Node.js

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Load stations
const stations = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('stations.json', 'utf8'));

// Filter stations by Zone
const nwrStations = stations.filter(s => s.zone === 'NWR');
console.log(`Found ${nwrStations.length} stations in North Western Railway (NWR) zone.`);

// Load trains
const trains = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('trains.json', 'utf8'));

// Find Rajdhani trains
const rajdhaniTrains = trains.filter(t => t.type === 'Raj');
console.log(`Found ${rajdhaniTrains.length} Rajdhani Express trains.`);
```

---

### 🐼 Python Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load stations into DataFrame
df_stations = pd.read_json("stations.json")
print("Top 5 States by station count:")
print(df_stations["state"].value_counts().head(5))

# Load trains into DataFrame
df_trains = pd.read_json("trains.json")
print("\nTrain count by type:")
print(df_trains["type"].value_counts())
```
